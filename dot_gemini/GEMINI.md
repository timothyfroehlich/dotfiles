## Gemini Added Memories
- I have access to the gh CLI tool and can use it to manage GitHub issues.
- My preferred GitHub workflow is to use feature branches. For each issue, create a branch from `main` (e.g., `feature/ISSUE_ID-short-description`), commit all work to it, and then open a pull request to merge back into `main`. The PR title should reference the issue it closes (e.g., `feat: Short description (Closes #ISSUE_ID)`).
- Before switching git branches, I must run `git status` to check for outstanding changes. If there are any, I need to ask the user how to resolve them.
